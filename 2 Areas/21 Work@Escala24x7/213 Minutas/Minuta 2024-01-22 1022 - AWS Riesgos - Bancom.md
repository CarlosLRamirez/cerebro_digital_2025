Análisis de Riesgos - Proyecto Migración AWS
Análisis de Riesgos - Proyecto Migración AWS
**AI meeting summary:**

- The transcript discusses various topics related to the migration of a system called hcm. The speakers mention that there are changes in IP addresses and approvals involved in the process, which could take three to six months. They also discuss the option of leaving the hcm on-premises or moving it to a cloud solution, but this would require significant changes and have a high impact.
- They mention that there is a need for metrics and interactions data from the hcm system to evaluate migration scenarios. The possibility of maintaining the current hardware with updated software is considered, as well as potential options for testing configurations.
- There are discussions about obtaining support from Tails (the vendor) for purchasing and updating equipment, including considerations for remote management capabilities. Additionally, they talk about potential challenges with key management systems (hsm) and how it may impact other components within the architecture.
- Overall, further analysis is needed to determine specific actions and recommendations regarding IP changes, migration scenarios, hardware updates, metrics collection, support agreements with vendors like Tails Inc., certification processes for compatibility between legacy systems and new solutions.

**Action items:**

- From the transcript, there are several follow-ups and action items that can be identified:

**1.** Follow-up: Verify the feasibility of migrating the hcm solution to the cloud with the specialists. This would involve evaluating the compatibility of the current components with the new environment.

**2.** Action Item: Gather metrics on the hcm interactions and network traffic to better understand the level of interaction and the scope of the migration.

**3.** Follow-up: Explore the possibility of utilizing the existing premises hcm solution in the Data Center of Conectria, which could potentially reduce latency and simplify the migration process.

**4.** Action Item: Contact Tails, the vendor of the current hcm solution, to discuss the process of renewing or updating the hardware.

**5.** Follow-up: Determine the availability of a testing environment or a quality environment for the hcm solution to conduct thorough testing and validation.

**6.** Action Item: Gather information on the interactions and traffic of the hcm solution to evaluate the impact and feasibility of migration.

**7.** Follow-up: Evaluate the option of deploying the hcm solution in the Data Center of Conectria and assess the requirements for remote management and configuration.

**8.** Action Item: Consult with Alexis Mantari, the project manager at the bank, to validate the requirements and determine the necessary steps for renewing the hardware.

**9.** Follow-up: Investigate the possibility of obtaining a test unit or accessing a testing environment for the hcm solution to conduct further analysis and verification.

**10.** Action Item: Assess the compatibility and integration of the existing components with the new hcm solution, considering the need for reconfiguration or adjustments.

**11.** Follow-up: Confirm the availability of a quality environment for conducting thorough testing and certification, especially for the interactions between the hcm solution and other components.

**12.** Action Item: Evaluate the scenario of relocating the hcm solution, taking into account the interactions, dependencies, and potential impact on other components within the ecosystem.

- These follow-ups and action items aim to gather more information, evaluate options, and plan the migration or renovation of the hcm solution effectively.
