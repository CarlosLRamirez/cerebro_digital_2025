MIMIX for IBM i is different than MIMIX for IBM AIX.

I don’t know what MIMIX for IBM i can do and can replicate.

MIMIX for IBM AIX can only replicate mounted filesystems and LVM LVs.

Filesystems mounted by OS at boot time are not configurable for replication.

OS filesystems no protected by MIMIX for AIX and are not configurable into the MIMIX Replication Group:

/dev/hd4               /             

/dev/hd2               /usr          

/dev/hd9var         /var          

/dev/hd3               /tmp          

/dev/hd1              /home         

/proc                     /proc         

/dev/hd10opt     /opt          

Thanks,



And for a quick, in a nutshell, explanation to emiro is mimics replicate lvM. Logical lv that is created.

And the lv has to be present for replication because mimics is load into the kernel. And after the kernel is loaded, all the file system belong to the os at startup time.

Mimics cannot see those anymore because they are loaded.

So in order for mimics to replicate the lv and the file system, the raw device has to be present. So mimics cannot replicate the os file s


1.  Do not make changes to the Source Server environment.
2.  Do not changes to the Sybase database filesystems and LVs.

Attached.
Snapshot filesystems / LVs.


Hola William,

Please monitor replication log for us.

>  tail -100 /var/log/E*S*/scrt_lca-1.out

Please also run the command below and send me the output, for my document.

/usr/scrt/bin/mxsmit SHOWRGINFO  'itau-sybase'

Please **do not** make any changes to the environment and / or reboot the server until SuperTx (initial sync is completed).

In case you have questions, please email me or set up meeting.

Mucha gracias,

Soon


Carlos,

This test is ran on Target LPAR.  Hostname:  itau-sybase.

Attached is the snapshot  test output from Target LPAR ran on July 11th, after the Replication Group Initial sync completed.

Thanks,
